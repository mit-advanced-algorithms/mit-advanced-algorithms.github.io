% 6.5210J/18.415J: Advanced Algorithms

This course is designed to be a capstone course in algorithms that surveys some of the most powerful algorithmic techniques and key computational models.
We will cover a broad selection of topics including amortization, hashing, dimensionality reduction, bit scaling, network flow, linear programming, and approximation algorithms. Domains that we will explore include data structures; algorithmic graph theory; streaming algorithms; online algorithms; parallel algorithms; computational geometry; external memory/cache oblivious algorithms; and continuous optimization.

For more details, see the [course information](info.html).

## Announcements

* If you intend to take this course please fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/kHhiGbPnushjgtGD6). Note that this form does NOT replace official registration via MIT Registrar's office, it's for our own internal bookkeeping.
* We will be using NB, a tool that permits students to discuss and ask questions about lecture videos, notes, and problems sets. For feature reasons we will be using one version of the tool to view and discuss videos and another to view and discuss notes and problems sets. You should sign up for NBv1 at [this link](http://nb.mit.edu/subscribe?key=NHkINbBuyc6gmLS06GO1OTnG47s9otSUnIFmM3eytwkvVQxj64). You will get a separate invite for NBv2.
* We've added this class to [psetpartners](https://psetpartners.mit.edu), which you can use to find collaborators and comply with the collaboration policy which limits the number of psets you can work on with any individual collaborator.
