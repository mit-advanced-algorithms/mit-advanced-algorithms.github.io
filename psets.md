Because of peer grading constrains, each pset will be submitted to a seperate Gradescope "course".
Go to [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/) and click "Enroll in Course" in the bottom right, then enter the pset's corresponding gradescope code.

Make sure your pset submission adheres to the [submission guidelines](/info.html#submission) and the [collaboration policy](/info.html#collaboration).

If you're turning a pset in [late](/info.html#late-submissions), please fill out the [late form](https://forms.gle/xgSmqLfbkJWndFmG7).

After every pset please also fill out the **mandatory** [time report](https://forms.gle/ujym9fhPaP6qpH7z9) due the next Monday by 2:30.

According to the [peer grading policy](/info.html#peer-grading) you are required to grade one problem during the semester.
To volunteer to grade a particular pset, fill out the [grading signup form](https://forms.gle/BET4T7hFPtNVk1v47) before that pset's due date. It is likely that more people will sign up then can grade on a given week. If you are not chosen, just fill out the form again another week. Chosen graders will be notified by the end of class on the pset's due date via email
